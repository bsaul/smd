\usage{
compute_smd_pairwise(smd_parts)

compute_smd(D, S)
}
\arguments{
\item{smd_parts}{a \code{list} of components for from \code{\link{compute_smd_parts}}
computing standardized mean differences}

\item{D}{vector of differences for each level of a factor (will be length 1 for numeric values)}

\item{S}{the covariance matrix}
}
\value{
a single numeric value
}
\description{
This function is for internal package use only. See \code{\link{smd}} for usage.

\details{
Computes:

\deqn{
 d = \sqrt{D' S^{-1} D}
}

where \eqn{D} is a vector of differences between group 1 and 2 and \eqn{S} is
the covariance matrix of these differences. If \eqn{D} is length 1, the result
is multplied by \eqn{sign(D)}.

In the case of a \code{numeric} or \code{integer} variable, this is equivalent
 to:

\deqn{
  d = \frac{\bar{x}_1 - \bar{x}_2}{\sqrt{(s^2_1 + s^2_2)/2}}
}
where \eqn{\bar{x}_g} is the sample mean for group \eqn{g} and \eqn{s^2_g}
is the sample variance.

For a \code{logical} or \code{factor} with only two levels, the equation above is
\eqn{\bar{x}_g = \hat{p}_g}, i.e. the sample proportion and \eqn{s^2_g = \hat{p}_g(1 - \hat{p}_g)}
(NOTE: interally \code{smd} uses the \code{\link[stats]{var}} function, which
uses \eqn{n-1} as the denominator. Hence, in small samples, \eqn{s^2_g} will
not be precisely \eqn{\hat{p}_g(1 - \hat{p}_g)}).
